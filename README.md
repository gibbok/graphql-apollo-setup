# GraphQL Apollo Setup

Testing GraphQL Apollo Setup in Mono repo structure using Turborepo.

The setup includes:

- Client and Server using Apollo Server.
- Generating TypeScript type from GraphQL definitions.
- Generating hook for data fetching.

This project demonstrates how to transform data provided from the server into data suitable for the View.

The branch called `transform` contains experimentation with Apollo Link and Root query field policies.
